Example website for mobile app + with demo desktop version. Created with MUI and React Hook Forms.
_This is only a showcase website, there is not an actual CHASE. app._

## About CHASE. and idea behind it

This is an app which should help programmers manage time more properly. Setting up task for couple days in the week or only one day, all of time the available time during the week will be deducted from tasks.
With notifications suggesting to stand up or drink water during work, as well as famous 20/20/20 rule to look away.
Our health and our time is important, so I've come up with an idea to help us with those common struggles.
